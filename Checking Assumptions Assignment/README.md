# Assignment Checking Assumptions in Linear Models

## Overview
This assignment focuses on checking assumptions in linear regression models, such as linearity, normality of residuals, and leverage points, using the "Exercise" dataset.

## Key Concepts
- **Linearity Check**: Uses ggpairs to examine linearity.
- **Residual Analysis**: Examines the studentized residuals for normality.
- **Leverage and Cookâ€™s Distance**: Identifies high-leverage points.

## How to Run
- Open `Checking_Assumption.R` in RStudio.
- Run the script to visualize the diagnostics and assess assumptions.

## Dataset Used
- Exercise Data from [here](https://www1.aucegypt.edu/faculty/hadi/RABE6/Data6/Exercise5.12.txt).
