# Assignment: Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview
This assignment explores multiple linear regression using two datasets: **Examination Data** and **Cigarette Consumption Data**. It compares different models to predict exam scores based on midterm scores and cigarette sales based on demographic factors.


## Key Concepts
- **Intercept Model**: Baseline model with no predictors.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates models with P1 and P2 as predictors.
- **Model Selection**: Selects the best model based on RÂ² and p-values.

## How to Run
- Open `Multiple_Linear_Regression.R` in RStudio.
- Run the script to compare the models and generate predictions.

## Datasets Used
1. **[Examination Data](https://www1.aucegypt.edu/faculty/hadi/RABE6/Data6/Examination.Data.txt)**:
   - This dataset includes exam scores (F) and midterm scores (P1 and P2).
   
2. **[Cigarette Consumption Data](https://www1.aucegypt.edu/faculty/hadi/RABE6/Data6/Cigarette.Consumption.txt)**:
   - This dataset includes sales data along with demographic predictors (age, income, price, etc.).
