# R Assignments: Data Science and Statistics

This repository contains a collection of R assignments completed as part of the Statistics coursework at Roanoke College. Each assignment focuses on different statistical and Prediction concepts, utilizing various datasets and methods.

## Assignments Overview

### 1. **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Objective**: Explore multiple linear regression to predict exam scores and cigarette sales.
- **Datasets**: 
  - [Examination Data](https://www1.aucegypt.edu/faculty/hadi/RABE6/Data6/Examination.Data.txt)
  - [Cigarette Consumption Data](https://www1.aucegypt.edu/faculty/hadi/RABE6/Data6/Cigarette.Consumption.txt)
- **Key Methods**: Model comparison, hypothesis testing, ANOVA.

### 2. **Checking Assumptions**
- **Objective**: Assess assumptions of linear models using diagnostics such as residuals and leverage.
- **Dataset**: [Exercise Data](https://www1.aucegypt.edu/faculty/hadi/RABE6/Data6/Exercise5.12.txt)
- **Key Methods**: Residual analysis, leverage, Cook’s distance.

### 3. **Categorical Predictors**
- **Objective**: Investigate the effects of categorical predictors in regression models.
- **Dataset**: Randomly generated categorical and quantitative data.
- **Key Methods**: Dummy variables, residual analysis, model comparison.
